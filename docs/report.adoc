== Design goals

The main design goal was to decrease the required amount of cpu cycles with at least 50% when calculating a hash using the Xoodyak algorithm. Calculating a hash should be as fast as possible since it is mainly used to validate data. This validation is often often required for security and not functioning, therefore it could be considered some sort of overhead.

== Software only

=== Setup

The characterization of the software only version was done in the following way. The message was `67` bytes long and a `32` byte long digest was calculated.

// Calculate hash

cyclist_absorb(&cy, msg, MSG_LEN);
cyclist_squeeze(&cy, digest, DIGEST_LEN, 0x40);

// Stop counter
counter_stop();
int ctr = counter_get_value();

=== Results

==== Counter

Counter value was `0x0005C7BE` which corresponds to 378814 cycles.

==== Binary size

The size of the final compiled ELF was `3028` bytes.

== Hardware software codesign

=== Setup

The main function of this test was identical as in <<sw-source, Listing 1>> and the same `32` byte long digest of a `67` byte long message was calculated.

The Xoodoo permutation function was substituted by a hardware design. This design consisted out of a `xoodoo_permutation` component and `APB_xoodoo` component with the latter connecting to the APB bus and driving the former. `xoodoo_permutation` has a fsm with four states as represented in <<fig-fsm, Figure 1>>.

. Ready: wait to start until `data_valid`.
. Load: load input state and set `round_ctr`.
. Permute: do permutations until `round_ctr` drops to zero.
. Finished: hold output state until `data_valid` clears.

The data path for this component is shown in <<fig-datapath, Figure 2>>.

=== Results

==== Counter

Counter value was `0x0000E244` which corresponds to 57924 cycles.

==== Binary size

The size of the final compiled ELF was `2380` bytes.

== Comparison

The main goal, to make the Xoodyak hash calculation faster, was achieved in the hybrid design. With `MSG_LEN=67` and `DIGEST_LEN=32`, it needed 15.3% of the execution time of the software only version. However, as demonstrated in <<fig-len-cpu, Figure 3>>, this difference increases for bigger messages.

The size of the final binary with dedicated hardware was only 78.6% of the software only version's size. Obviously dedicated hardware requires more LUTs and registers.
